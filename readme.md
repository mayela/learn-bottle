# Build an API with Bottle

In this little tutorial we are going to learn how to create a little TODO list 
API with Python and the microframework Bottle.

Python is a programming language most known because his easy-to-read sintax. It's 
used for web development, scripting, test automation and machine learning.

Bottle is a microframework web that helps to serve the data needed for this little
 project.

First we need to create a virtualenv, we're gonna use pipenv for this purpose. 
You can install pipenv with the following command:

```$ pip install --user pipenv```

Once you have installed *pipenv* we need to create a new directory for our project.

```
$ mkdir learn-bottle
$ cd learn-bottle
```
